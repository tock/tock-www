multi-tasking operating system for microcontrollers.

## A Tock-based Bootloader

@bradjc mixed some [existing
pieces](https://github.com/thejpster/tockloader-proto-rs) with some
good-old-fashion [elbow grease](https://github.com/tock/tock-bootloader/pull/9)
to rewrite the bootloader we use for the SAM4L (Hail and imix boards) using
Tock! Better yet, most of the code is completely portable and can be used for
any chip ported to Tock that has a UART, flash and GPIO implementation.
