This is the 24th post in a series tracking the development of Tock, a
safe multi-tasking operating system for microcontrollers.

1. TOC
{:toc}


Maybe it's just some remaining pent-up excitement after taking a break to write
papers a couple months ago. Or maybe it's just the bright sun keeping us in our
windowless labs,[^1] but the last few weeks have seen a notable uptick in
activity on the Tock repo. As we march forward towards a deployment of the
Signpost sensor network, and gear up for tutorials at [RustConf] and [SenSys],
we've been knocking off features.

The theme this week is managing both low-power sleep and clock choices in the
kernel.

## Low Power is close!

One of the main features Signpost needs from Tock is low-power operation. In
particular, it's the responsibility of the kernel to enter into the lowest
power state when it sleeps (i.e. whenever there are no active events to run).

Our initial goal is to run typical applications and have Tock enter the SAM4L's
deep-sleep state, which consumes ~5&mu;A with full RAM retention. In this
state, effectively the only things that can wake the CPU up are the
asynchronous timer (AST), certain pin interrupts (EIC), and an I2C device
(TWIS). But this matches typical sensor network applications: they'll sample
some sensors, transform the data in some way and potentially send some network
packets, then go to sleep for a certain amount of time (i.e. to be woken up by
a timer).

We now have basic functionality in place to support this, and are working on
implementing the accounting in each each low-level chip-specific driver. So
far, it seems that the implementations are fairly straightforward.

## ADC Clock Management

An ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) is a hardware controller that converts a
continous analog signal, with infinite granularity, into a digital one that can
be processed by a computer. ADCs typically operate in one of two modes: a
single-shot mode that captures a single analog reading and a continuous mode
that captures an analog signal over time. For example, audio is often encoded
as a 44kHz analog signal, meaning the analog value from a microphone needs to
be captured every 22μS.

In order to support a wide range of continuous ADC intervals, an application
needs to be able choose different clock sources for the ADC controller. For
example, on the SAM4L, the main system clock struggles to provide sampling at
frequencies slower than 23Hz. On the other hand, the choice of clocks is very
hardware specific (microcontrollers don't have a standard set of clocks) so
it's better if applications don't have to choose clocks explicitly, but let the
kernel (particularly hardware-specific drivers) choose the optimal clock based
on the requested interval.

@petarpenkov implemented this capability for the SAM4L. Upon request for
continuous sampling at a given frequency, the slowest clock that can provide
this frequency is chosen. This effectively incorporates the RCSYS and RC32K
clocks working at a maximum of approximately 3600Hz and 1000Hz, respectively.
