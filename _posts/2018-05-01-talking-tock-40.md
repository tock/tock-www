## 1.1 Kernel Released

The April rolling release (version 1.1) has been tagged and pushed. The most
significant improvements in this release are a new, more readable and less
error prone regiter interface and a resource ownership based clock manager for
the SAM4L. With both of these used now nearly ubiquitously in the kernel, SAM4L
based boards automatically go to deep sleep when there are no active
peripherals.

Ports to the nRF52 development kit and Hail and imix, based on the Atmel SAM4L,
are considered stable and are backwards compatible with 1.0. An initial port to
the CC26xx series of platforms is included but not yet stable. The stabilized
system call ABI does not include any new peripherals since 1.0.
