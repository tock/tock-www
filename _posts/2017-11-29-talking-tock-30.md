This is the 30th post in a series tracking the development of Tock, a
safe multi-tasking operating system for microcontrollers.

Are now posted to <https://docs.tockos.org> automatically!

## World Tour

We literally went around the world in November!

First, we went to Shanghai to attend [SOSP
'17](https://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp17/). We gave a tutorial the day before
the conference and presented a [paper](/assets/papers/tock-sosp2017.pdf) on
Tock on the second day.  Next, we were in Delft for [SenSys
'17](http://sensys.acm.org/2017/). We gave _another_ tutorial there, and
presented demos for Tock and Signpost.

## A Growing Community

There are now a growing number of active contributors from a variety of
institutions using Tock for a bunch of reasons. I'm going to try my best to
keep an account of what folks are doing and update here. But I'll probably miss
some.

A brief overview:

  * Researchers at U.C. Berkeley are continuing to work on and deploy
    [Signpost](https://github.com/lab11/signpost).

  * There are a number of ongoing projects at Stanford:

    * 6lowpan/Thread support

    * A low power MAC for 802.15.4

    * Dynamic clock management for the SAM4L

    * Support for the Teensy board

  * Students at Chalmers University are starting to work on power-aware process
    scheduling and potentially native support for connection-oriented Bluetooth
    Low Energy on the NRF52.

  * @niklasad1 continues to improve BLE advertising on the NRF52, including
    currently advertising from unique addresses from each application.

  * Some folks from the community have begun working on ports to the STM32
    series of microcontrollers.

  * @JayKickliter and @Vagabond having been adding support for various
    controllers to the NRF52 for some, as of yet, undisclosed project.
