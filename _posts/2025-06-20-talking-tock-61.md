Following on Talking Tock #60(2025-05-15-talking-tock-60.md), we have
established an
[x86 working group](https://github.com/tock/tock/tree/master/doc/wg/x86).
This working group will steward Tock development (include userspace and tooling)
related to Tock running on x86 platforms. With representation from multiple
companies, the working group will help ensure x86 support grows while meeting
the needs of Tock's users.

Background on Working Groups
----------------------------

Tock uses a working group model to oversee Tock development for important sub
areas. For example, the Networking WG oversees Tock's support for subsystems
including Thread and Ethernet, and the Documentation WG manages the
[Tock documentation](https://docs.tockos.org/kernel/) and
[book](https://book.tockos.org). Currently, the Core WG serves as the backstop
for all development not related to other working groups, and oversees the other
working groups.
