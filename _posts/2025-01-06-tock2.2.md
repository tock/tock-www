Version 2.2 of Tock has just been
[released](https://github.com/tock/tock/releases/tag/release-2.2)! The 2.2
release marks significant improvements from the 2.1.1 release. Some major
highlights include:

- An [extension](https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/3577) to the `yield` system
  call enabling userspace to block for a specific upcall.
- There are no longer any nightly Rust features required to build Tock, enabling
  platforms to use stable Rust.
- Process loading now includes machinery for validating credentials attached to
  Tock processes.
- Support for the OpenThread networking stack in userspace.

Many more improvements and fixes are detailed in the [release
notes](https://github.com/tock/tock/releases/tag/release-2.2).

Hardware-Assisted Continuous Integration
----------------------------------------

Tock 2.2 marks the first release which was tested with the help of a CI workflow
running on the physical hardware boards Tock targets. One challenge with
embedded development is testing: full and accurate testing requires running the
code on the actual target hardware. With the
[integration](https://github.com/tock/tock-hardware-ci) of
[treadmill](https://github.com/treadmill-tb/treadmill) into Tock's CI, tests for
the release were run automatically on the nRF52840dk hardware platform.

This improvement will enable more consistent Tock releases going forward.
