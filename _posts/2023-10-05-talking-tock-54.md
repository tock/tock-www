With [pull request #3578](https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/3578) merged, the
Tock project has officially added its third working group! This group will focus
on the networking stack within Tock. Quoting from its
[charter](https://github.com/tock/tock/blob/master/doc/wg/network/README.md):

> The goals of the Tock Network Working Group (NWG) are to:
>
> - design a set of interfaces (traits) for networking
> - design the user land interfaces for networking
> - define how buffer management should be implemented
> - determine other kernel infrastructure useful for networking
