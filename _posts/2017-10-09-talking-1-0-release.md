title: Announcing Tock 1.0
subtitle: A stable ABI

The Tock team is happy to announce the first stable version of Tock, 1.0. Tock
is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent,
mutually distrustful applications on low-memory and low-power microcontrollers.

## What's in 1.0

Tock version 1.0 stabilizes the Application Binary Interface (ABI) of Tock
processes, including the binary format of processes on flash, the semantics and
behavior of the five system calls, and the driver interface exposed through
system calls for a basic set of portable interfaces.

The goal is to be able to write cross-platform processes that will run on any
Tock kernel that is 1.0 compliant. For this version, stability means that those
interfaces will not change until, at least, the next major version. In other
words, if you write a process to that uses only the stable drivers and it
doesn't work as expected, it's either a bug in the kernel or a bug in the
userland library (and we appreciate [bug reports
&hearts;](https://github.com/helena-project/tock/issues/new)).

## System Calls

Tock understands five system calls:

  1. `command`

  2. `subscribe`

  3. `allow`

  4. `yield`

  5. `memop`

The first three are routed to specific drivers based on the first argument
passed by the process. `command` is used for very short lived operations,
`subscribe` lets processes register a callback for completion of a long-running
operation, and `allow` shares a process buffer with a kernel driver.

`yield` blocks the process until a callback is available and `memop` controls
the process memory layout.

## Stable Drivers

The drivers listed below are stable as of 1.0. More drivers will become stable
in future minor versions, and details of each interface can be found at

## Tock Binary Format

Tock processes are represented using the Tock Binary Format (TBF). A TBF
includes a header portion, which encodes meta-data about the process, followed
by a binary blob which is executed directly.
