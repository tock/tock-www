[Google has released OpenSK][gblog], an open-source implementation for security
keys. [OpenSK is an application][opensk-gh], designed to run on top of Tock.
Today, it targets the Nordic nrf52 chip dongle.

We are excited to see real-world, security-conscious applications deployed on
Tock. We're also excited for future efforts in this space, in particular the
emerging [Tock on OpenTitan][tock-ot] effort. If you are interested in getting
involved, get in touch with the [emerging Tock/OpenTitan working group][tock-ot-wg].

In the meantime, check out OpenSK in action!
