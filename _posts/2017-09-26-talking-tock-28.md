title: Talking Tock 28
subtitle: Recapping the last couple months

This is the 28th post in a series tracking the development of Tock, a
safe multi-tasking operating system for microcontrollers.

How long has it been since our last update? Nearly two months??? Well, ain't
nobody getting paid to post these, and I've been busy. Since our last update we
ran a training at RustConf, the students working with us over the summer made a
lot of progress towards a [Thread](http://threadgroup.org) implementation and
our paper was accepted to SOSP '17. Exciting stuff!

## Niklas Speaking at RustFest

If you're attending [RustFest](http://zurich.rustfest.eu/) in Zurich this weekend, be sure to go see our
own @niklasad1 give a talk on his master's thesis work (with @frenicth) on
porting Tock to the NRF51 and implementing a pure Rust Bluetooth Low Energy
stack.

His talk is on Saturday after lunch at 2:30pm.

## RustConf Training

There was an incredible turnout for the Tock training at RustConf. After a few
last minute sign-ups, we ended up with a 30-person room at capacity. From our
informal survey of the room (a more formal one coming), there were folks from
big companies (like Mozilla and Intel), small companies (like Helium), and no
companies. It was a really great meeting all of you, and thanks for turning
up!

We went over the general design of Tock, then worked with [Hails]({{
  "/hardware/hail" | relative_url }}) to write a capsule that sampled
accelerometer data and a userland application in Rust. All the training
materials are available in the main Tock repo
<https://github.com/helena-project/tock/tree/master/doc/courses/rustconf>

We'll be running similar tutorials (though more geared for academics) at SOSP
and SenSys, and James Munns will be running an embedded Rust workshop at
RustFest next weekend with some overlap. So if you weren't able to attend
RustConf, there will be other opportunities!

## Thread/6lowpan Progress

Hubert Teo (@bbbert), Paul Crews (@ptcrews) and Mateo Garcia (@mog96) are three
Stanford students who worked over the summer to implement 6lowpan and Thread
support for Tock. Briefly, 6lowpan is a standard for tunneling IPv6 packets
over the low-power 802.15.4 wireless radio standard (the same one used in
ZigBee). It's a fairly common standard in wireless sensor networks in
academia, and has also been picking up steam in home automation recently
thanks to the Thread group standardizing a set bunch of related protocols
around 6lowpan for network configuration (if you're working on Thread
professionally and are reading this, when are we getting an OnHub router that
supports Thread??).

Implementing full support for Thread turns out be a pretty big task
since it involves a handful of different protocols as well as some low-level
802.15.4 features that hadn't been implemented for the RF233 driver in Tock. It
also took some effort to get a test rig up since there isn't any commercially
available hardware that supports Thread natively just yet.

Nonetheless, the students did a really impressive job. As of the end of the
summer, Tock has support for 6lowpan compression and decompression, support for
packet fragmentation (pending a pull request being merged), most of the Thread
security layer, and support for parsing network provisioning messages.

Their end of the summer [write-up]({{
  "/assets/papers/tock-os_thread-protocol-implementation-status_2017-08-31.pdf"
  }}) gives more details on their implementation effort and includes a really
nice summary of the Thread/6lowpan stack.

## SOSP Paper

We just submitted the camera-ready (i.e. final version) of a paper we wrote
detailing the design and implementation of Tock for SOSP (Symposium on
Operating Systems Principles). You can [read the full
paper](/assets/papers/tock-sosp2017.pdf). We also posted a summary
[yesterday]({% post_url 2017-09-25-sosp-paper %}).

## Pull Requests

There has, of course, been plenty of regular work going on, too. The numbers of
pull requests merged and proposed is a bit overwhelming, so I broke them into
categories this time.
