Anyone working with or on Tock is encouraged to join community communication platforms:

  * Join the [devel@lists.tockos.org](https://lists.tockos.org/postorius/lists/devel.lists.tockos.org/) mailing list for general development discussion, questions, and announcements.
  * Join other [mailing lists](https://lists.tockos.org) for working-group or topic specific discussions.
  * Join us on [Matrix (#tock:tockos.org)](https://matrix.to/#/#tock:tockos.org) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tockos/shared_invite/enQtNDE5ODQyNDU4NTE1LWVjNTgzMTMwYzA1NDI1MjExZjljMjFmOTMxMGIwOGJlMjk0ZTI4YzY0NTYzNWM0ZmJmZGFjYmY5MTJiMDBlOTk) to chat.

## Contributing

Tock is under heavy development, primarily focused on a few chips and
platforms. We will soon be releasing our primary development platform (based on
Atmel's SAM4L). Until then, if you want to port Tock to another platform, we
encourage that and will try to help as much as we can.

The main repository is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/tock/tock).

## Conduct

We follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html).
