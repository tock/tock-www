## Tock, Secure Root-of-Trust, and IoT

We will be holding a full-day tutorial at [MobiSys](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2025/)
on the Tock Operating System. This event will take place on June 27, 2025.

The goal of this tutorial is to provide members of the mobile systems and
computing community a contemporary guide to the foundations of security for
modern computational systems.

The event is divided into four semi-independent sessions. The first session
invites __TBD: lightning talks? posters? what do we want to solicit?__

Each of the subsequent technical sessions is a mixture of educational content
and hands-on hardware experience. Over the course of the day, we will develop
an end-to-end system which dynamically deploys signed, verified applications
onto edge, microcontroller-class devices where the application will generate a
stream of tamper-proof sensor readings for a cloud endpoint.

While participants are encouraged to attend for the full day, each session aims
to be sufficiently standalone to allow "drop-ins" for different portions of the
event.

### Call For Lightning Introduction Talks

We encourage participants to submit one slide introducing themselves and their
research area. During the first session of the tutorial we will invite
participants who submitted a slide to introduce themselves, their background,
and their interest in secure IoT operating systems. Our goal is to get better
sense of the participants in the tutorial so we can facilitate a more
interactive tutorial and adapt some of the content based on participant interest
and background.

Please submit your slide **here** in either `.pdf` or `.pptx` form.

If capacity for the tutorial is reached priority will be given to participants
who have submitted an introduction slide.
