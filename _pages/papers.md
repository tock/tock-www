    _Note: This workshop paper reported on challenges we ran into early on
    building Tock in Rust. After feedback from the Rust developers and the
    community, we were able to overcome those challanges without
    modifications to the language. We also learned that we understated how
    disruptive some of the changes we proposed would be to the language and
    do not believe they are worthwhile. This [has
    been](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rfc-and-paper-experiences-building-an-os-in-rust/3110)
    [discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3nbt2d/ownership_is_theft_experiences_building_an/)
    [extensively](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/655816/ownership_is_theft_experiences_building_an/)
    now in the Rust community. You should read this paper critically, not as
    conclusive scientific findings, but as the perspectives of the authors
    during a particular point in the development of Tock._
